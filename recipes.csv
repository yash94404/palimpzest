Evidence for a strain-tuned topological phase transition in ZrTe5,"Single-crystal ZrTe5 was grown with the flux method (21). Zr slugs (99.9% pure, Alfa Aesar) and Te shot (99.9999% pure, Alfa Aesar) were loaded into a quartz ampule in a Zr:Te ratio of 1:100. The ampule was warmed to 900°C in 9 hours, kept at 900°C for 72 hours, and then cooled to 505°C in 48 hours. To promote large crystal growth, the ampule was repetitively cooled to 440°C and warmed to 505°C. Last, the ampule was cooled to 460°C and decanted in a centrifuge at this temperature.",ZrTe5

Superconductivity in the quaternary intermetallic compounds LnNi2B2C,"Samples were prepared by arc-melting and annealing. The starting materials were lanthanide metal shavings or sublimed dendrites (99.9 or 99.99% pure), Ni powder (99.99%) and coarse C (99.99%) and B (99.6%) powders. Samples of 0.75 g total weight were pressed into 0.25-inch-diameter pellets, which were then arc-melted under argon on a standard water-cooled copper hearth three times, with the melted button turned over between melts. Investigation of the Lu-Ni-B-C chemical system revealed the presence of superconductivity in quaternary Ni-rich compositions. From electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, in conjunction with physical property measurements, we deduced that the superconductivity was associated with a phase of tetragonal symmetry, with unit-cell dimensions a= 3.46 A and c = 10.63 A. This phase was obtained as very well formed single crystals directly from melts of composition LuNi4B3C, mixed with finely crystalline Ni2B and very small quantities of a third phase. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that the superconducting phase has the composition LuNi2B2C. Crystallized melts of this composition are not single-phase, showing that the new superconductor does not melt congruently. Annealing the arc-melted buttons (wrapped in tantalum foil, and sealed in evacuated quartz tubes) for 12-36 hours at 1,050-1,100 °C yielded polycrystalline material with less than 2% impurity phase present.",LuNi2B2C

"Large, non-saturating magnetoresistance in WTe2","High-quality single crystals of WTe2 were grown by means of Br2 vapour transport. Tungsten powder (99.9%) was ground together with purified tellurium (99.99%), pressed into a pellet and heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 uC for 2 days; this was homogenized and then reheated at 750 uC for a further 2 days. This final pellet was ground into a fine powder and a temperature gradient of 100 uC between 750 and 650 uC in a three-zone furnace was used for crystal growth, with a Br 2 concentration of ,3m gm l21 in a sealed quartz tube for 1 week. Optimal crystals were obtained under these conditions; crystals grown at higher temperatures showed substantially lower residual resistivity ratios r(300 K)/r(2 K) and degraded magnetoresistance. The need to employ low-temperature synthesis to avoid defect formation that degrades properties is frequently observed in TMDs, for example in TiSe2 (ref. 31). The crystals grew as thin ribbons (Fig. 1b), with the long direction being the W–W chain direction and the larger flat faces being perpendicular to the stacking direction of the layers.",WTe2
"Weak Van der Waals Stacking, Wide-Range Band Gap, and Raman Study on Ultrathin Layers of Metal Phosphorus Trichalcogenides","Crystal Synthesis. A stoichiometric amount of high-purity elements (mole ratio M:P:chalcogen = 1:1:3, around 1 g in total) and iodine (about 10–20 mg) as a transport agent were sealed into a quartz ampule and kept in a two-zone furnace (650–600 °C). The length of the quartz ampule is about 16 cm with a 13 mm external diameter. The pressure inside the ampule was pumped down to 1×10–4 Torr. After 1 week of heating, the ampule was cooled down to room temperature with bulk crystals in the top.",2D semiconducting metal phosphorus trichalcogenides
Observation of Fermi arcs in the type-II Weyl semimetal candidate WTe2,"Whereas most of the previous measurements have been carried out on WTe2 crystals grown via chemical vapor transport using halogens as transport agents [36,44], we have grown WTe2 single crystals from a Te-rich binary melt. High purity, elemental W and Te were placed in alumina crucibles in W1Te99 and W2Te98 ratios. The crucibles were sealed in amorphous silica tubes and the ampoules were heated to 1000°C over 5 h, held at 1000°C for 10 h, and then slowly cooled to 460°C over 100 h and finally decanted using a centrifuge [45].",WTe2
Heavy-fermion superconductivity in CeCoIn5 at 2.3 K,"Single crystals of CeCoIn5 were synthesized from an In flux by combining stoichiometric amounts of Ce and Co with excess In in an alumina crucible and encapsulating the crucible in an evacuated quartz ampoule. Because of the deep eutectic formed between Ce and Co and the strong phase stability of CeIn3, growth of CeCoIn5 appears to be optimized in dilute (3 at.% Ce) melts with a two-stage cooling process—an initial rapid cooling from 1150 °C, where the molten material is homogenized, to 750°C and then a slower cool to 450°C, at which point the excess flux is removed with a centrifuge. The resultant crystals are well-separated, faceted platelets with characteristic dimensions 3 mm× 3 mm × 0.1 mm.",CeCoIn5
Growth of single crystals from metallic fluxes,"There are several general techniques for the growth of single crystals from metallic fluxes. The basic criteria that distinguish one from another are either the required operating temperatures or the method of extracting the crystals from the flux. For temperatures below 1200°C, sealing of the crucible in a quartz ampule is advantageous, since it provides a protective environment for the sample growth, contains volatile materials and, as will be discussed below, allows for an extremely simple removal of the crystals from the flux via centrifugal force: spinning off the flux. For temperatures over 1200°C or volumes greater than 5ml, sealing the materials in quartz is no longer practical, and protective atmospheres must be provided in other ways. Even so, molten flux can, in some cases, still be removed via spinning, if the spinning temperature is below 900°C, the highest practical temperature, in our opinion, for spinning in an unheated centrifuge. The most common method of maintaining the proper crystal growth environment is to seal the materials into a quartz ampoule. The starting materials are placed in a crucible inert to the melt, with materials having the higher melting temperatures on the bottom. As the low-melting materials melt they flow over the higher-melting materials and start incorporating them into the melt. The crucible itself is placed in a sealed evacuated quartz ampoule and slightly elevated off the bottom of the tube by shards of quartz. This is to avoid cracking the quartz tube as a result of differential expansion between the tube and the crucible. Finally, there is a plug of quartz wool above the crucible that acts as the filter during flux removal. After the crystals are grown, but at temperatures still above the melting point of the flux, the ampoule is taken out of the furnace, inverted in the cup of a centrifuge and quickly spun. This forces the still-liquid flux through the quartz wool and leaves the crystals in the crucible. If there is reason to believe that there may be a seeding problem caused by the presence of the quartz wool dust, then the crystals can be grown in the ampoule without the wool and subsequently sealed in another tube with quartz wool and heated to the desired spin-off temperature. Another method of removing crystals from the flux involves chemically etching the solid flux away from the crystals, but this places a stringent requirement on the etchant; it must attack the flux much more quickly than it does the crystals. This is the case for many Al flux growths, since Al can be eaten away by NaOH solution, which often does not attack the desired materials. Other examples where this works are the cases of the R,Pt,Ga,-Ga, CeCu,Ge,-In and YbCu,Si,-In growths. The Ga and In can be eaten by concentrated HCl which does not attack the crystals. Unfortunately, it is often the case that the solvents that will attack the flux also attack the crystals with an equal or greater enthusiasm. This is the case with RSb-Ga growths. Etching away the flux can also sometimes be achieved through electrolytic erosion. Finally, there is always the option of mechanically removing the crystals from the solidified flux. This is not the preferred route, since it is time consuming. In this paper we shall concentrate primarily on the materials that can be removed either via spinning off the flux or by chemical etching.",single crystals of intermetallic compounds
Aluminum p-type doping of silicon carbide crystals using a modified physical vapor transport growth method,"We report the development of a modified physical vapor transport (PVT) growth setup for the improved aluminum p-type doping of silicon carbide (SiC) single crystals. Usually aluminum doping of SiC is carried out by adding the dopant to the SiC powder source material. However, due to aluminum source depletion a strong exponential decrease of the dopant incorporation with increasing process time is observed. In addition, often defect generation takes place due to a high initial aluminum sublimation rate. In order to improve the aluminum supply we have installed an additional gas pipe which provides a continuous flux of aluminum atoms out of an external reservoir into the growth cell. We will discuss the influence of the additional gas flow on the thermal field and mass transport inside the growth cell. Technological steps will be pointed out which were necessary to establish crystal growth with structural properties comparable to the conventional PVT process. With the modified PVT method high quality SiC single crystals with an improved axial and lateral aluminum doping homogeneity were grown (4H-SiC: 2/C21016 cm/C03opo4/C21016 cm/C03; Dp=po10%; 6H-SiC: 8/C21016 cm/C03opo1:21017 cm/C03; Dp=po25%). r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Superconductivity near 30 K without copper: the Ba 0 _6Ko.4BiO 3 perovskite,"Owing to the expected volatility of alkali oxides, we decided to investigate the Ba-K-Bi -O phase diagram using sealed silver tubes. Starting materials were BaO, KO 2, and Bi2O 3, and the reactions were carried out at 675 °C for 3 days. Materials produced by this technique allowed us to identify the perovskite-structure compound as the bulk superconductor in this chemical system. When the starting materials are mixed in the stoichiometric perovskite ratios, Ba 1 _ _ ,K .. BiO 3, only a few per cent superconductivity is observed, even in materials which appear to be single phase by X-ray diffraction. The amount of superconductivity observed increases dramatically when excess alkali is employed in the starting mixture. Further, the as-synthesized materials are not superconducting, but require a low-temperature anneal in oxygen to optimize the superconducting properties. Exploring this multi-dimensional parameter field led us to the following preliminary optimal conditions: single-phase perovskite of stoichiometry Ba0_6 Ko.48iO3 _ 8 is prepared by adding 100% excess KO 2, in 2-g batches, heated at 675 °C for 3 days, in 0.25-in. diameter sealed silver tubes, 6 in long, and sealed in turn in evacuated quartz tubes. The material removed from the tubes is dark red or brown in colour. It is ground and then annealed in flowing oxygen at 475 °C for 45 min, and quickly (<5 min) cooled in the oxygen flow. The resulting powder has a deep blue-black colour. It is then pressed into pellets for measurement. Oxygen anneals at higher temperatures or longer times result in the loss of potassium from the (Ba,K)BiO 3 _ 8 compound.",Ba 0_6K0.4BiO 3
Bulk Superconductivity at 91 K in Single-Phase Oxygen-Deficient Perovskite Ba2YCu309 — b,"Single-phase Ba2YCu309 — b was prepared by our mixing BaCO3, Y203, and CuO, grinding, and heating at 950 C in air for 1 d. This material was then pressed into pellets, sintered in flowing 02 for 16 h, and then cooled to 200 C in 02 before removal from the furnace. Additional overnight treatment in 02 at 700 'C was found to improve the observed properties. The oxygen content for this material was determined by our heating a sample in H2 at 900 C for 2 h and measuring the weight loss on reduction to Cu metal and BajY oxides, yielding the value 6=2.1+ 0.05.",Ba2YCu309 — b
Bulk Superconductivity at 36 K in Lat gSro 2Cu04,"La2 „Sr„Cu04 compounds were prepared from the appropriate mixtures of high-purity La(OH)3, SrCO3, and CuO powders, heated for several days in air at 1000'C in quartz crucibles, with several intermediate grindings. For x =0.1 and 0.2, single-phase tetragonal K2NiF4-type material was obtained with lattice parameters of approximately an=3.78 A and en=13.23 A as determined by powder x-ray diffraction. For the x =0.3 material there was an increase in co from x =0.2, but an extra diffraction peak on the order of 2%-3% of the maximum major-phase intensity was observed, suggesting that the limiting stoichiometry of the K2NiF4-type phase prepared in air at 1000'C is just below x =0.3. The powders were pressed into pellets and annealed at 1100'C for 6 h in air, and cooled to room temperature by removing them from the furnace while at the annealing temperature. Portions of the sintered pellets were used for resistivity and susceptibility measurements, and portions were annealed in flowing 02 at 900 C for 1 day, cooled to room temperature in the 02 flow, and characterized to determine the effects of the annealing atmosphere on the observed properties.",La2-xSrxCuO4

These tubes were sealed in a second evacuated silica ampoule and placed in a furnace at 750 °C. The temperature was held constant until the Se vapor had disappeared/H208493–5 days/H20850and then increased to 1075 °C for 3 days, followed by a fast decrease to 420 °C. This temperature was held for 2 days before the tubes were quenched in −13 °C brine. Small pieces were then loaded into small silica ampoules and annealed at various temperatures/H20849300–500 °C /H20850 for 2 days followed by quenching in −13 °C brine. Fast quenching was required for reproducible behavior. All samples are stable for short periods of time in air but were protected from oxidation in air by storage in an argon glove box.",FeSe
Variation of transition temperatures and residual resistivity ratio in vapor-grown FeSe,"Single crystals of FeSe were prepared by a chemical vapor transport technique using elemental Fe and Se and a eutectic mix of the chlorine salts, KCl and AlCl3 (molar ratio 1:2), in a constant temperature gradient. The furnace was tilted at an angle of ∼15°–20° to enhance convection (see Fig. 1). The Fe:Se ratio, the temperature conditions, and the amount of starting materials were varied. A total of more than 20 batches were studied. Powder x-ray diffraction was performed using a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The compositions of crystals from three batches were determined using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS). Magnetization was measured using a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID in a field of 20 Oe under zero-field cooled conditions and with arbitrary orientation of the often very small single crystals. Multiple pieces were checked for each batch. Electrical resistance was measured using a LR-700 resistance bridge, and contacts were made with silver epoxy and silver paint.",FeSe

Description of Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering in Correlated Metals,"To fully capitalize on the potential and versatility of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), it is essential to develop the capability to interpret different RIXS contributions through calculations, including the dependence on momentum transfer, from first principles for correlated materials. Toward that objective, we present new methodology for calculating the full RIXS response of a correlated metal in an unbiased fashion. Through comparison of measurements and calculations that tune the incident photon energy over a wide portion of the FeL3 absorption resonance of the benchmark material BaFe2As2, we show that the RIXS response in BaFe2As2 is dominated by the direct-channel contribution, including the Raman-like response below threshold. Calculations are initially performed within the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, which we then significantly improve by invoking a quasiboson model to describe the secondary excitations within the intermediate state. This enhancement allows the many-electron RIXS signal to be approximated as a convolution of BSE-calculated spectra with effective spectral functions. We construct these spectral functions, also from first principles, by employing the cumulant expansion of the Green’s function and performing a real-time time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the response of the electronic system to the perturbation of the intermediate-state excitation. Importantly, this process allows us to evaluate the indirect RIXS response from first principles, accounting for the full periodicity of the crystal structure and with full dependence on the momentum transfer.",BaFe2As2
